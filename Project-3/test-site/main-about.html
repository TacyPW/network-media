    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The "Target is for Everyone" project was born out of our desire to create a shopping experience that truly reflects the diverse world we live in. We believe that every individual deserves to be celebrated and included, and that's exactly what this initiative represents.</p>
    <p>Through our inclusive practices and product offerings, we aim to break down barriers, challenge norms, and promote a sense of belonging for transgender and nonbinary individuals. By embracing and respecting everyone's unique identities, we hope to create a world where diversity is celebrated and inclusivity is the norm.</p>
