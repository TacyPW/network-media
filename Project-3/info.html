<h3>Part 1: Concept / References</h3>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p> I will be making a website that interrogates target's recent decision to stop selling 
    certain pride themed merchandise specifically relating to trans identity. It will be a Yes Men style 
    website that makes the claim that "target is for everyone" which it clearly isn't. Ultimately, the 
    site will make it clear that it is nonsensical to seek inclusion in capitalist frameworks like target
    because they will only ever be inclusive insofar as it is profitable for them. 
</p>
<h4>References</h4>
<p>
the main reference I will be using is <a href="target.com">target's own website</a>.
