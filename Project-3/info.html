<h3>Part 1: Concept / References</h3>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p> I will be making a website that interrogates target's recent decision to stop selling 
    certain pride themed merchandise specifically relating to trans identity. It will be a Yes Men style 
    website that makes the claim that "target is for everyone" which it clearly isn't. Ultimately, the 
    site will make it clear that it is nonsensical to seek inclusion in capitalist frameworks like target
    because they will only ever be inclusive insofar as it is profitable for them. 
</p>
<h4>References</h4>
<p>
the main reference I will be using is <a href="target.com">target's own website</a>.
</p>
<h3>Part 2: Design Concept and Content</h3>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p> 
this website should feel like it copletely follows target's current design guidelines, but it should not look 
exactly like target's existing website. I want it to seem like an ancillary website that is speaking to this cause and
then links back to the main website, which i intend to do. 

this is an idea of the graphics that could be included: 
<img src="assets/every.png" alt="target is for everyone logo">
</p>
<h4>Content</h4>
<p>
    here is a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GmwPgdk9Ik_JAHx57zC6DT0OYMO-rcj6Bi5JK_6es0E/edit?usp=sharing">a google doc</a> where I have compiled ai generated content for this website.
