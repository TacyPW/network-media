            Is a third year student in DESMA. They are interested in the rep&shy;resentations of information and emotion across
            physical and digital media, specifically looking at the differences and contrasts. With this project, they
            aim to explore  the feasibility of representing a perspective or thought process through type design. Fonts are 
            usually a highly general tool that, while it may have certain ethos, is meant to be used for many different messages
            what changes when type is more specific than that, made to represent thoughts within a specific way of thinking?
