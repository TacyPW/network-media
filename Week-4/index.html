        <h3>Response:<br><a href="https://www.ibraaz.org/essays/163/">Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age, Archiving as an Act of Resistance | Ibraaz</a></h3>
        <p>
            I'm interested in how Lara Baladi speaks about the instability of the
            internet, in context of its vast documentation possibilities, and its intrinsically 
            ephemeral nature. I have thought a lot about the ephemeral nature of the internet. 
            One example of this is how websites stop getting updated over time, links break, 
            new conventions are formed, and generally, old media becomes less accessible. Another
            example is how our access to information on the internet is governed by regulatory 
            entities, whether they are private, like google, or any ISP, or public, like the FCC. 
            Baladi talks about all this and more in her essay, specifically in context of protest
            movements in Egypt. She references the <a href="http://035644b.netsolhost.com/ibraaz/projects/voxpopuli/">Vox Populi: Tahrir Archives</a> as an example of 
            a project trying to preserve the original meaning and accessibility of web content
            across time. It looks a lot like how archivist work looks with physical
            ephemera. In general, I think we need to think of internet media 
            more like this, as something that needs to be preserved in light of
            its ephemeral nature.
