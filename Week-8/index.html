        <h2>Response:<br><a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DS_Deepfakes_Cheap_FakesFinal-1.pdf">DEEPFAKES AND CHEAP FAKES</a></h2>
        <p>
            I'm interested in the variation in public perception of new AI technologies. This article addresses the public fears about deep fakes, but I also want to explore varied ideas around text based ai technology. I visited my family a couple days ago and I was discussing chatgpt with my mom, who is an english teacher. She was telling me about increased difficulties she is having to detect whether her students are cheating or not. I thought it was interesting to hear her ideas on how one could tell if a paper had been written by an AI by comparing its tone to the studentâ€™s other work and her idea of their writing level. She feels very negatively about these new tools, and responded negatively to my view that they will become omnipresent in the coming years. I was interested to consider the reasons why our opinions might be different, from my position as a student to hers as a teacher, from my age as a young person to hers as a middle aged person, etcetera.
