        <h2>Response:<br><a href="https://www.joaap.org/issue9/zachblas.htm">Informatic Opacity - Zach Blas</a></h2>
        <p>
            This article provides an interesting angle towards the conflict of privacy in today's world. Zach Blas discusses the ways that data can be more transparent (accessible) or opaque (hidden) in different situations and modalities. This can be on a smaller or larger scale, but either way, there is a conflict between accessibility and transparency, versus privacy and self determination. Blas explores some interesting ideas on the ideas of information opacity on an individual basis, concerning topics like identity and expression in conjunction with realities of surveillance. Citing the similar conflict in social justice movements between sharing one's identity for larger awareness, versus constructing one's identity in a personal way, within a hyperlocal community. We face the choice of whether to share our truth, or to hide our identity. The way I would make that decision would likely be based on how safe I felt in the greater society, and how I thought I would be understood by other members. This means that we need a larger degree of societal open mindedness to enable a smaller degree of information sharing. But to enable a larger degree of societal open mindedness, we need more understanding of individual identities across the society. This is a cyclical paradox that could either go towards large understanding, or vast obscurity. I think it's human nature to be defensive, which would lead us to be less giving with our information in this context. This is part of the same human instinct that causes us to create groups and distance ourselves from other groups. But this mode of thinking is not compatible with the basic ethical fact that all groups of people are just as valid and valuable, so if we want to structure our society in a way that represents that, weâ€™re going to have to figure out a different way of responding to this basic human nature.
